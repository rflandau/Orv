/*
The Orv package provides utilities for constructing and querying Orv Vaults: self-organizing, decentralized, service discovery trees.
The meat of the package is the prototype VaultKeeper, which can be utilized via orv.NewVaultKeeper().
Call the static subroutines (ex: List()) to make requests of an existing vault.
*/
package orv

// This file a placeholder for the orv package documentation.
//
// You probably want vaultkeeper.go for the prototype VK implementation or requests.go for static subroutine for making requests against an existing VK.
//
// For building your own leafs and VKs, take a look at the packet descriptions in packets.go.
//
// Lastly, orv_test.go includes useful examples about how to generate packets and send heartbeats (see the helper subroutines near the top).
